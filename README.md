**Power BI Sales Performance Dashboard for an e-Commerce Store**

**Project Overview**
This Power BI dashboard provides an end-to-end analysis of sales performance across regions, product subcategories, and customer segments for a global beauty and personal care brand. Designed for business leaders and marketing strategists, the dashboard uncovers key trends, profit challenges, and actionable opportunities to drive sustainable growth.

****Business Problem**
The business experienced strong year-over-year (YoY) growth in sales but observed a concerning decline in profit margins. Leadership needed clear visibility into what was driving growth, where profitability was leaking, and which product lines or market segments warranted more strategic focus.

**Key Insights**
•	$6.36M Total Sales, marking a 50% YoY growth — an impressive revenue achievement.
•	Profit, however, declined by 34.6%, totaling just $1M — indicating operational inefficiencies or rising costs.
•	Asia Pacific leads regional performance with $1.8M in sales, followed by Europe and LATAM at approximately $1.3–1.4M each.
•	Top-Performing Subcategories:
o	Eye Shadows and Pencils – $604K (56.8% YoY growth)
o	Shampoos & Conditioners – $618K (47.3% YoY growth)
o	Face Moisturising Products – $445K (51.7% YoY growth)
•	Customer Segments:
o	Consumer and Corporate segments dominate with $6M+ in combined sales, both growing at approximately 50%.
o	Self-Employed segment, though small, showed the highest YoY growth at 55%.
Areas of Concern
•	Lipstick sales showed 0% growth YoY, a potential red flag for shifting market demand or weak product engagement.


**Strategic Recommendations**
1.	Conduct a Profitability Review
Investigate rising costs across the supply chain and operations to identify why profit is not keeping pace with sales.
2.	Scale High-Growth Subcategories
Double down on fast-growing categories like eye shadows, shampoos, and moisturizers with promotional bundles and targeted marketing.
3.	Revive Stagnant Products
Reassess the lipstick product line — explore rebranding, shade innovation, influencer partnerships, or seasonal launches.
4.	Capitalize on Emerging Markets
Africa shows a 66.7% YoY growth rate. Expand marketing and distribution efforts in this region to capture untapped demand.
5.	Segment-Specific Campaigns
Build tailored strategies for niche segments like Self-Employed consumers who are showing strong growth momentum.
